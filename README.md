fec-parse is a streaming Node module to parse raw FEC electronic filings. Currently a mashup of the Ruby gem [Fech](https://github.com/NYTimes/Fech),by Derek Willis and others, and the node [csv-parser](https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser) module by Mathias Buus, Max Ogden and others. Currently in heavy development, and nobody should use for anything serious.
