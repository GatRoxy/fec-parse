Identification Number:  C00409797
RE:  October Quarterly Report (07/17/2014 - 09/30/2014)
Response Due Date:  January 2, 2015

Dear Mr. Holly:

We write in response to the Commission's letter dated November 27, 2014. Regarding Schedule D, the debt in question was a disputed debt, and the committee and its vendor ultimately resolved their bona fide disagreement over the amount owed. The committee will amend its prior reports to clearly identify the debt as disputed. If you have further questions, please contact the committee.

Sincerely,

Michael Remington
Treasurer
Conyers for Congress
